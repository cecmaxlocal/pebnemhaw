Why Study Emacs Lisp?

Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association 
only with Emacs, it is a full computer programming language. 
You can use Emacs Lisp as you would any other programming 
language.

Perhaps you want to understand programming; perhaps you want 
to extend Emacs; or perhaps you want to become a programmer. 
This introduction to Emacs Lisp is designed to get you 
started: to guide you in learning the fundamentals of 
programming, and more importantly, to show you how you 
can teach yourself to go further. "

Why Study Emacs Lisp?

Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association 
only with Emacs, it is a full computer programming language. 
You can use Emacs Lisp as you would any other programming 
language.
