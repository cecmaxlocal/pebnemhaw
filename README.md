**Pebnamehaw** is a powerful and lightweight Lisp scripting engine designed for the **Soaps Editor IDE**. It allows developers to extend, automate, and customize the editor's functionality using a flexible and expressive Lisp dialect.

Whether you're creating complex macros, building custom UI components, or automating your workflow, Pebnamehaw provides the tools you need to make the Soaps Editor truly your own.

## ✨ Features

- **Full Lisp Environment**: A feature-rich Lisp dialect tailored for scripting.
- **Seamless IDE Integration**: Access and manipulate editor components, text buffers, UI, and more via a simple API.
- **Fast Execution**: A lightweight interpreter ensures your scripts run quickly without bogging down the editor.
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax and extensive documentation make it easy to get started.
- **Script Management**: Easily load, reload, and manage your scripts from within the Soaps Editor.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Soaps Editor](https://example.com/soaps-editor) v2.0 or higher.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository into your Soaps Editor scripts directory:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pebnamehaw.git ~/.soaps-editor/scripts/pebnamehaw
    ```
2.  Open the Soaps Editor.
3.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
4.  Run the command `Pebnamehaw: Reload Scripts` to load the engine.

## 💡 Usage Example

Create a new file `hello.lisp` in any of the project's subdirectories (e.g., `./Client/hello.lisp`).

Add the following code to the file:

```lisp
;;; A simple script to show a notification in the Soaps Editor

(defun say-hello (name)
  (editor:show-notification
    (format "Hello, %s! Welcome to Pebnamehaw scripting." name)))

;; Call the function
(say-hello "Developer")
```

Save the file and run `Pebnamehaw: Run Last Modified Script` from the Command Palette. A notification will appear in the bottom-right corner of the editor.
